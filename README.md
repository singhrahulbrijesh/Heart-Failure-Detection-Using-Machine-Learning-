Short Introduction
About 400,000 adults die of heart failure (HF) in the United States every year. HF occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to support the organs in the body [CDC]. Cardiovascular research studies have identified correlations between creatine levels, ejection fraction rates, and HF. Using machine learning classifiers, a patient's survival can be predicted based on important clinical features.
